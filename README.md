# Flying-RC-Jet
We will build a high-performance delta-wing RC jet with carbon fiber spars, powered by twin BLDC motors and a custom EDF system, featuring active thrust vectoring and Arduino-based PID gyro control. The project delivers a flying prototype, open-source firmware, and full build documentation.
